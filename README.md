| https://sumiya.page     | Blog to share things I have learnt and experienced.<br/><br/>Originally started in 2016 as https://algoclinic.com to share what I was learning on Data Structure and Algorithms. With an explosion of online resources around these topics though, I thought it would be better to share things that are unique to me, but may be generally useful for someone else too.<br/><br/>This is when I registered https://sumiya.page. At this time, content for both sites are served from the same S3 bucket. General setup is Browser -> Google DNS -> Amazon Route 53 -> CloudFront -> S3<br/><br/>Source: https://github.com/psumiya/blog |
